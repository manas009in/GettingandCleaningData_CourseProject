# GettingandCleaningData_CourseProject
Submitted by: Maanas Mutreja

This is a Repo for the submission of the course project on Getting and Cleaning Data MOOC course by John Hopkins University.

#Overview

This project demonstrates the collection and cleaning of a data set into a tidy dataset that can be used for subsequent analysis. A data used in this project can be found at The UCI Machine Learning Repository (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)
The source data for this project can be found here (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).

#Making Modifications to This Script

Once you have obtained and unzipped the source files, you will need to take following 2 steps to before you can process the data.
1. In run_analysis.R file you need to set the working directory to your local drive or a public drive where you may be saving your data.
2. Save the data from Zip file in the working directory.

#Project Summary

The following is a summary description of the project instructions

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set 
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

#Additional Information

You can find additional information about the variables, data and transformations in the CodeBook.MD file.
